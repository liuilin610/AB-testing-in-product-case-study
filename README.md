# AB-testing-in-product-case-study

This project describes a AB testing through purchase rate and bounce rate on a website, including 1200 data, 60 categories for 20 days. A sanity test between variant group and the pool group (Control plus variant group) is necessary. This data set is not significant to verify null hypothesis in user type (new or old users), purchase channel ( diract link, email, ....) and time. It iw worth reconsidering the setting of experiments or more testing.
